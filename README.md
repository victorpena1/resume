PROJECTS
--------
•	Portfolio Optimization: Used Python to data mine 6000 NYSE stock prices from the Alpha Vantage API. Created a mini relational database using SQLite. Manipulated raw data to find 100 days average performance, volatility, betas, correlations and covariances. Normalized and identified the top performers with the lowest coefficient of variance and iterated for portfolio weight optimization. <br>
